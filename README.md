# Power-Hour

Power Hour allows a contractor or freelancer to create time entries per client & project. A user simply enters a client name, project name, time in/time out, and pay rate - their total hours worked and total pay for that time entry are automatically calculated. Users are provided a table layout of all entries per client.
